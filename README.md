## NX-Audio
This tool's data structure is wrong, It works tho, it wont be optimized as an audio by UbiArtPY by Eliott, but this is an alternative for people that cant find OpusEncoder.

### Requirements
- FFMPEG

### TODO
- Possibly refactor the code and understand the right data structure

If you found this useful dont mind leaving a star!
